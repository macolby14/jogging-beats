## Motivation

I love running to music to help me keep pace and would love a tool to explore new songs. I am building <strong>Jogging Beats</strong> to help keep my music fresh for my runs. This website uses the Spotify API to help you find songs at a certain tempo (beats per minute). The interface automatically generates a list of songs for a user based on their target tempo and workout time and then allows the user to select which songs they want and easily create a playlist on their spotify account.

## Technologies

Frontend:

- React
- Next.js
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Styled Components

Other:

- Spotify API
- Next.js serverless functions
- OAuth
- Hosted on Vercel

## Work in progress:

- Allow to select genres

- Allow users to "shuffle" their current selection to see more songs
- Allow users to share playlist more easily on mobile
- Add testing
